### Connect and Transfer a file to SFTP server

🚀 Excited to share a Python snippet I've been working on for seamless SFTP file transfers! 🐍💻

With the power of pysftp and paramiko, I've crafted a robust solution for connecting to an SFTP server, listing directories, and uploading files securely. Whether it's automating data backups or streamlining file exchanges, this code simplifies the process.

🔒 Secure: Supports password authentication or private key authentication for enhanced security.
📂 Directory Listing: Easily lists files and directories on the remote server.
⬆️ File Upload: Effortlessly transfers files from local to remote, maintaining directory structure.
